# Overview

**NB: Work in progress**

TRL-3D is a 3D graphics mark-up system build on C#, OpenTK, and OpenGL that makes it easy to programmatically create 3D content using a text editor.

Main goals:

* Specify 3D content using a simple Term Rewriting Language (TRL) in a way similar to specifying HTML content for webpages
* Process user input events and reference elements from the original TRL elemens in event handlers
* Use a build-in global "black board" architecture for world logic and rules
